##### About
Targaros (generally and preferably (by herself) shortened to "targ") is part of the staff of Hamium. She posts the ***History Gazette*** daily and is the main Historian. She has been a part of hamiumFactions since late [season 3](../seasons/s3.md).

###### Season 3

During season 3, Targaros greatly helped the [Greenie Company](/factions/gc.md) (at the time The Greenies). She made their faction base [The Avarous Clocktower](/structures/season3/tgbase.md). She also built her base closeby.

###### Season 4

Although still running, she hasn't done much, except briefly join and leave the [SKY CREW](/factions/sc.md).

##### Other Details
Targaros lives in Argentina, and that is all the personal information she wishes to share with most people.
