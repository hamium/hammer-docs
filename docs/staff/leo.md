Leo first met Ham, Unium, and Slim before the server was released in another smp, Bombacraft. Inside hamiumFactions, Leo created the role of historian, and documented the events and history of the server from seasons 1, 2, and 3, stepping down as main historian at the end of season 3. Currently, Leo is senior historian and helps Targaros with the daily newspaper.
