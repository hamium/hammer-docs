# Welcome to the hamiumWiki

This is the wiki mainly for the hamiumFactions community, containing information about [players](staff/unium.md), [structures](structures/spawn_s4.md) and [factions](factions/cia.md), during [past](seasons/s1.md) and current seasons. However, references to other hamium communities such as [racks](extra/racks.md) are also included.
