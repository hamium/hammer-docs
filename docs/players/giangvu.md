##### :material-account-question: About
Giangvu, generally shortened to simply "Giang" is a prolific builder of the server. He has built and planned almost 3 different bases across 2 seasons. He was a member in DRON (Democratic Republic of Noxus) in Season 3, and currently, a member of the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) <br>

##### Season 3

Giangvu has a love for all things related to the Navy. His builds are directly or indirectly related to naval battles and incidents on the ocean. Some of his builds, which are remarkable achievements on their own, are listed below : <br>
1. Mount Dronmore at DS (Dragon Slayers) Base of DRON. It was a recreation of Mount Rushmore, but with the Minecraft heads of the DRON members, instead of American Presidents.<br>
2. USS Samuel B. Roberts. It was a replica model of the real life destroyer.<br>
3. Twin Towers.<br>

##### Season 4

Giangvu joined ***Lolrussy's*** faction, Commie Ghosts. He founded the CG base. However, the faction disbanded due to inactivity of its members. Next, Giangvu joined [***Hades***](../players/hades.md) in the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) faction. <br>
During his time in the IE, he has built many small structures to house the mechanical farms. He created a crane lifting an *Iron Block*, in which he built a passive Iron Farm. This farm was later modified and upgraded to an active Iron Farm by [***iSark***](../players/isark.md). He also built a Wild West themed *Water Tower*, which covered the original Iron Farm of [***IE***](../factions/ie.md). This was later cleared out and repurposed into a String Duper by [***iSark***](../players/isark.md), since the farm never worked. <br>
Tired of living on a *Floating Village* with no ground to build up from, Giangvu started the Land Upgrade of the base, and also started building a replica of the Bikini Atoll Nuclear Test below the *Floating Isles*. He is modelling the *Floating Village* to resemble the Gibraltar Islands.
