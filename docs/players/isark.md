##### :material-account-question: About

iSark (generally shortened to "ishark") has been a part of Hamium since late [***Season 3***](../seasons/s3.md). He has been a member - notwithstanding inactive - of [***racks***](../extra/racks.md) since **July 23, 2023**.

##### Season 3

In Season 3, he joined [leunium's](../staff/unium.md) faction - DRON. He spent majority of his time trying to get gear, and also built the trunk of a massive Cherry Oak Tree, which would house an Iron Farm. However the untimely end to the season, combined with his exam preparations, hindered his progress greatly. The Cherry Oak Tree was left unfinished.

##### Season 4

In season 4, he joined ***lolrussy's*** Commie Ghosts faction. However, the faction disbanded due to inactivity. Afterwards, he joined the [***Banana Syndicate***](../factions/bs.md). However, that faction also disbanded due to inactivity. Lastly, he joined the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md), which would remain his current faction.Some of his notable achievements were : <br>
1. He created the fastest iron farm on the server.  <br>
2. He is one of the few players to have the extremely rare Silence Trim. <br>
3. He became a Helper in the shortest time possible. This promotion to Staff was mainly due to his contributions to wiki and overall knowledge about programming.<br>
