##### :material-account-question: About
Hades was an important member in DRON (Democratic Republic of Noxus) in Season 3, and the current leader of the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) <br>
He joined the server on *December 25, 2023* at the very start of [***Season 3.***](../seasons/s3.md) <br>

##### Season 3

Some of his notable achievements include :<br>
1. He practically founded the ***Dragon Slayers*** (DS) base on a cliffside near [***Lockheed Martin***](../structures/season3/lms3base.md) (LM) base of DRON. The nation of DRON prospered with DS and LM as its capitals. <br>
2. He became arguably one of the richest on the server in terms of valuables (diamonds, netherite, ancient debris, elytras etc.).<br>
3. He was one of the first to creat large-scale farms, like the Raid Farm, redesigned the trading hall at the Notre Dame (ND) base of DRON, and much more. <br>

##### Season 4

This season Hades joined the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) faction. <br>
Some of his achievements this season include:<br>
1. He was the first person on the server to obtain an Elytra in [***The End***]() event<br>
2. He has spent 7 hours of real-life time to trap a zombie for his iron farm (it broke after 2 minecraft days)<br>
3. His plans for the season is to expand onto the Floating Isles, as well as, re-create the ***DS*** base over the Mushroom Cliffs.<br>
Exams have hindered his progress this season, as was the case with [***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md). <br>
