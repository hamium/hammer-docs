> "Ajipot's wedding got delayed for 2 hours then another 30 minutes. The fireworks were used before the wedding even started. People started killing each other in the middle of the ceremony  Kaeud then brought the attendees to a cactclub where they all got wasted and started killing each other. According to ajipot, "we lost our shit and people started threatening each other, fireworks shot— blew up important shit and we lost those shit (permanently— not really sure) and then everybody went home"<br>

##### Fred's POV
> "Hi there, my name is Fred. I am the mayor of my village. We heard that there was a wedding in our church far away so we went to attend. It was disastrous but very awesome. Then as we went back to our village, there was an elytra clad bride and she had a lot of TNT. She annouced that she will take over our village and wanted us to cooprate. Naturally, one of our brave warriors attempted to save us. Our well and radish farm got destroyed. She gave us a list of demads to follow, noth'n much. We give low prices without being sentenced to the zombie as well as renaming our village to somthing bomb?"<br>
