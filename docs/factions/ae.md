##### :octicons-goal-16: Goal
The Aerial Empire was created by [***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md), even before the season had begun. He recruited many of his old faction members from ***Salmon Faction*** in Season 3, like OHIO_STATE, iamstove, _Izotz, etc. The goal of the Empire was to be the most influential and powerful on the server, rivalling the [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md). <br>

##### :octicons-trophy-16: Achievements
The AE is one of the most successful factions on the server. It has achieved many admirable feats, such as:<br>
1. The strategy of alliances was well applied by the Empire. The [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) became one of its first allies through mutual cooperation.<br>
2. The IE created efficient farms - the fastest Iron Farm by ItsLodus, a covert Trading Hall, and much more.<br>
3. The AE was the first faction to obtain a beacon.<br>
4. Personal achievements of members continue to accentuate the Empire's greatness.<br>

##### :fontawesome-solid-tent: The Kingdoms
The AE Base was split into two major parts : one on a Plains biome, near a Mesa, practically beside the World Border, and [***SKP's***](../players/itzskp.md) base.<br>
The main base consists of ItsLodus' Quad-Module Iron Farm, and OHIO_STATE's underground base.

[***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md) decided to create his base at the edge of a jungle, 7000 blocks away from the main base. The Kingdom of Colorido was born from a few huts - serving as his personal house, and a villager breeder, before expanding across the river to the farm estate. The entire base was designed with the lore (by _Izotz) as its backbone.

##### Alliances
The Aerial Empire, or the AE created an alliance with one of the strongest factions on the server - [***Internet Explorers***](ie.md). Many structures were built in collaboration, like the first Gold Farm, the first Slime Farm, etc. The alliance helped many new members to obtain gear and xp, and progress through the game in mere hours.<br>

##### The End Event
[***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md) profited largely in the End Event. He obtained multiple shulker shells and elytras for personal use. The other members would follow suit, in the subsequent days. <br>

##### Silence Trim Incident
A devious plot by [***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md) was to explore all the Ancient Cities in the 5000 by 5000 block area within world border in search of the fabled Silence Trim, and deprive all other members from it. It has a 1.2% chance of spawning in Ancient City chest. Amidst countless Wardens, the AE and the IE were the first to obtain it. While some Ancient Cities remain unexplored, the two factions were successful at making the trim extremely rare.<br>

##### The Period of Stagnation
The projects of AE was left incomplete, as many members lost interest in the server, or in the game entirely. Regular PVP fights on the AE grounds could not harbour enough enthusiasm. In the end, the AE remains as one of the most prosperous factions of the Season.
