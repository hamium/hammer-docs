##### :octicons-goal-16: Goal
The Communist Ghosts (CG) was the only Communist nation ever made in Season 4. <br>

##### :octicons-trophy-16: Achievements
The CG faction was the first faction to dissolve, particularly due to inactivity of its members. They had the least used Trading Hall.<br>

##### Problems
The Communist Ghosts' downfall was attributed to a significant lack of active players, because all the other players had began working on their nation already. Enticed with the rise of multiple factions like [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) and [***Aerial Empire***](../factions/ae.md), most members defected towards the active factions. Their leader, lolrussy, was also inactive meaning the CG had no leadership to follow. The final problem is [***ItzSKP***](../players/itzskp.md)'s continuous criticising of the nation, which finally lead to their downfall.

##### Defections of the Members
[***iSark***](../players/isark.md) was the first player to leave the CG. He joined the [***Banana Syndicate***](../factions/bs.md) with JackSmith. buk_08 followed by example as well. He would however carry the CG tag in-game for the longest time, due to an error by the staff.
[***Giangvu***](../players/giangv.md), after much deliberation, left to join [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md). ManBoyThing also did the same.

##### Decline
Lolrussy had to dissolve the CG faction, for it had fallen below the threshold of minimum 3 members. He joined [***Internet Explorers***](../factions/ie.md) as well, but remained quite inactive. GoldenWarrior was the last remnant of the Communist Ghost faction, and he was banned only recently for using a racial slur. Thus, the cottage on a hill which the CG faction called home would be desolate for the forseeable future.  <br>

##### Attempt at Revival
With the permission of [***Giangvu***](../players/giangv.md), two rookie players, Adam (his real-life friend) and Vector, occupied the CG Base. Lolrussy had transferred all responsibilities of the disbanded faction to Giangvu, before becoming inactive once more.
