##### :octicons-goal-16: Goal
The Sovereign League of Noxus was DRON (Season 3) reborn. It was created for the sole purpose of world domination.<br>

##### :octicons-trophy-16: Achievements
During its very short lifetime, SLON achieved some remarkable feats<br>
1. The largest Mob Farm was created by SLON, using 4 spawning towers.<br>
2. The members had personal riches, which implied that SLON was one of the most powerful factions during its time.<br>
More will be added to this list as their achievements surface...

##### :fontawesome-solid-tent: The Base
The main base of SLON was near a Twighlight Forest, overlooking a lake, at one corner of the world. The base is designed like a hobbit hole, and their Mob Farm towered in the distance. Unium's mansion is located on an isle.<br>

##### Alliances
SLON had mutual alliances with [***Internet Explorers***](ie.md) and [***Aerial Empire***](ae.md). Despite that, they had their own Gold Farm, and autonomous Industrial District.<br>

##### The Decline
Due to personal reasons and inactivity of the members, [***unium***](../staff/unium.md) disbanded the faction, when it dropped below 3 members. [***Kaeud***](../staff/kaeud.md) and him joined [***Sky Crew***](sc.md) after the faction was disbanded.
