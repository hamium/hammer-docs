The **Lockheed Martin** base was the faction base of [Lockheed Martin](/factions/s3/lm.md) and capital of the nation of [DRON](/factions/s3/dron.md). As it's name suggests, it was made based on a real life [Lockheed Martin](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Martin) building.
It had a portal to the nether roof, many farms and some shops, including Cana bar.
